simdjson v3.9.4

https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson

Apache-2.0 license

This code is made available under the Apache License 2.0.

Under Windows, we build some tools using the windows/dirent_portable.h file (which is outside our library code): it
is under the liberal (business-friendly) MIT license.

For compilers that do not support C++17, we bundle the string-view library which is published under the Boost
license. Like the Apache license, the Boost license is a permissive license allowing commercial redistribution.

For efficient number serialization, we bundle Florian Loitsch's implementation of the Grisu2 algorithm for binary to
decimal floating-point numbers. The implementation was slightly modified by JSON for Modern C++ library. Both
Florian Loitsch's implementation and JSON for Modern C++ are provided under the MIT license.

For runtime dispatching, we use some code from the PyTorch project licensed under 3-clause BSD.
